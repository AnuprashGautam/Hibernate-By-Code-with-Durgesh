Excellent question ‚Äî and a very insightful one, Anuprash üëè

Let‚Äôs unpack **why `Session.load()` was deprecated** in Hibernate, **even though it had better performance** than `Session.get()` in certain cases.

---

## üß© 1. The Background: What `load()` Used to Do

In Hibernate, the methods:

```java
session.get(Entity.class, id);
session.load(Entity.class, id);
```

look similar ‚Äî but they behave quite differently.

| Method   | Behavior                                                                 | Null Handling                                 | Performance                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `get()`  | Immediately hits the database to fetch the entity                        | Returns `null` if entity doesn‚Äôt exist        | Slightly slower                       |
| `load()` | Returns a **proxy object** (lazy loading) without hitting DB immediately | Throws `ObjectNotFoundException` if not found | Faster (if entity is accessed lazily) |

So, `load()` looked faster because it **didn‚Äôt fetch data until you actually accessed the object** ‚Äî it used Hibernate‚Äôs **lazy loading proxy** mechanism.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è 2. The Problem: Dangerous & Confusing Behavior

Even though it was *faster in theory*, it caused **a lot of subtle runtime problems**.

### (a) ‚ùå Unexpected Exceptions

If the entity didn‚Äôt exist in the database:

```java
Student student = session.load(Student.class, 10);
System.out.println(student.getName()); // Throws ObjectNotFoundException
```

This exception occurred *only when you accessed a property*, not at the time of calling `load()` ‚Äî which confused many developers.

---

### (b) ‚ùå Issues with Detached Sessions

If you called `load()` and then closed the session before accessing the proxy:

```java
Student student = session.load(Student.class, 10);
session.close();
System.out.println(student.getName()); // LazyInitializationException!
```

The proxy could no longer initialize itself, leading to the infamous `LazyInitializationException`.

---

### (c) ‚ùå Misleading Performance

In many real-world applications, you *almost always access* the entity data right after fetching it.
That means Hibernate ends up fetching it anyway ‚Äî so the so-called performance boost was often **negligible** or **negative** due to lazy-loading overhead.

---

### (d) ‚ùå Broader API Simplification

Modern Hibernate (6.x and beyond) aims for **simpler, safer APIs** that behave consistently and are easier to predict.
Since `load()` caused too many surprises, it was marked deprecated in favor of:

* `get()` (for immediate loading)
* `byId()` or `getReference()` (for proxy-based access when you truly need it)

For example:

```java
// Equivalent to old load()
Student student = session.byId(Student.class).getReference(10);
```

This makes intent explicit and avoids confusion.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Summary: Why It Was Deprecated

| Reason                     | Explanation                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| üß† Confusing semantics     | Throws exception lazily and behaves differently than `get()` |
| üö´ Unsafe behavior         | Causes LazyInitializationException when session closes       |
| üß© Redundant in modern API | `getReference()` and `byId()` replaced it cleanly            |
| ‚ö° Misleading performance   | Gains were minimal and often backfired in real use           |
| üîß API simplification      | Hibernate team deprecated confusing or legacy methods        |

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Modern Replacement

Instead of:

```java
Student s = session.load(Student.class, id);
```

Use:

```java
// If you want to get the actual entity
Student s = session.get(Student.class, id);

// If you truly need a lazy proxy reference
Student s = session.byId(Student.class).getReference(id);
```

Would you like me to show a small example comparing how `load()` and `getReference()` behave differently in Hibernate 6.x (with printed SQL logs)?
It‚Äôll make this difference very clear.
